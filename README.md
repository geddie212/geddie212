I have over 10 years experience as a software developer and proficient in:

<ul>
  <li><b>Version Control Systems - </b>Mainly Git and Github</li>
  <li><b>Web Development - </b>HTTP, HTML and CSS for the front-end and Python and server framework (Flask, Django) for the back-end</li>
  <li><b>Databases - </b>MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and MongoDB</li>
  <li><b>Cloud Computing Platforms - </b>Mainly AWS</li>
  <li><b>Web APIs and RESTful Services - </b>Mainly done using Flask or Django</li>
  <li><b>Data Analysis and Manipulation Libraries - </b>Pandas and NumPy</li>
  <li><b>Task Automation - </b>Depending on the job, but for web automation I use Selenium or APIs</li>
  <li><b>Machine Learning Libraries - </b>TensorFlow</li>
</ul>

Software development is always changing, new libraries, new methods, new technologies are constantly emerging and I get excited by learning and developing myself in the ever changing tech world.
